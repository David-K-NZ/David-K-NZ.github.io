## Project Story

A client was completing a design for a vehicle-mounted Hydrogen slush tank to be used to fuel vehicle in a remote setting. They realised they needed consideration to be made for the event of a rollover to ensure the tank and valve integrity was maintained. They reached out to Motovated, and I was tasked with completing a validation of a steel frame to protect the tank. This involved modelling the frame using Solidworks weldments, then analysing various loadcases with FEA. As this continued, the client requested some changes to the frame as their design iterated, but we found a final frame that would protect the tank well & be simple to manufacture.
