## Project Story
---
The client requested a standard seismic analysis and certification for a 40 kL horizontal cylindrical fuel storage tank, to be installed in a relatively high seismic zone in New Zealand. 

Design validation was conducted according to a series of publications/standards, including: NZS1170.5 - Earthquake Loading, Seismic Design of Storage Tanks 2009, AS1642 - Fuel Storage Tanks, AS1210 - Pressure Vessels, and AS3990 - Mechanical Steelwork.

Using the above standards, a path to compliance was established and followed. This included hand calculations for loading and hoop stresses, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for endwall stresses and saddle loading, and finally anchor calculations for setting the tank into the concrete structure below it.

During manufacture, there were some issues with completing the tank as designed. I completed some additional checks on the tank to ensure compliance with regulations was maintained, and that all reasonable precautions had been taken to prevent rupture in the worst case scenario.
