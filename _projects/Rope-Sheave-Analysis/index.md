## Project Story
---
A client requested a validation for a design of an aluminum rope sheave to be used in maritime lifting applications. The rope sheave used a non-conventional design to control rope through a 90 degree arc, whilst allowing some swivel. Design was considered through comparison to AS2089 - Rope Sheaves, AS2566.1 - Aluminium structures, and FEA of the sheave to find stresses at the applied/safety loads. This analysis found significant surface stresses, which were remedied through the inclusion of a gusset plate. This was validated in a physical lift test using the rope sheave in the intended manner, which allowed signoff for the rope sheave system.
