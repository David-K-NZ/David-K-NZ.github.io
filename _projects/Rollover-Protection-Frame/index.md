## Project Story

A client was completing a design for a vehicle-mounted Hydrogen slush tank to be used to fuel vehicle in a remote setting. They realised they needed consideration to be made for the event of a rollover to ensure the tank and valve integrity was maintained. They reached out to Motovated, and I was tasked with completing a validation of a steel frame to protect the tank. This involved modelling the frame using Solidworks weldments, then analysing various loadcases with FEA. As this continued, the client requested some changes to the frame as their design iterated, but we found a final frame that would protect the tank well & be simple to manufacture.

One of three load cases to be applied to the frame- horizontal load at central corner, as if truck has directly rolled sideways and was applying worst case load for the frame strength:

Initial Load case - Deflections under above applied load case, magnified by a factor of 20x for clarity in shape of deflection:

Stress Plot for above load case - Surface stresses at load point very high as expected. All other stresses within allowable range for material given this is an overload case:
